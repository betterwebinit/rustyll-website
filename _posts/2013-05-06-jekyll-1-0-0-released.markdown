Hey! After many months of hard work by Rustyll's contributors, we're excited
to announce the first major release of the project. v1.0.0 is
finally here! While the list of improvements and features is [quite extensive][history],
here are the highlights:

- Lightning-fast build times with parallel processing
- Complete Jekyll compatibility for easy migration
- Rust-powered performance and memory safety
- Built-in support for modern web development workflows

Take a look at the [Upgrading][] page in the docs for more detailed information about
migrating from Jekyll.
