[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) are public web pages for users,
organizations, and repositories, that are freely hosted on GitHub's `github.io`
domain or on a custom domain name of your choice. GitHub Pages are powered by
Jekyll behind the scenes, but you can use Rustyll locally for significantly faster development and then deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Using Rustyll with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages uses Jekyll to build your site on their servers, but you can use Rustyll locally to dramatically speed up your development process:

1. Build locally with Rustyll (10-100x faster)
2. Push your changes to GitHub
3. GitHub Pages will build and publish your site using Jekyll

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: Rustyll's speed for development and GitHub's free hosting with Jekyll.

### Setting Up a Workflow

Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and deploy your Rustyll site to GitHub Pages:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/rustyll-build.yml
name: Build and Deploy with Rustyll

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Setup Rust
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          profile: minimal
          toolchain: stable
          
      - name: Install Rustyll
        run: cargo install rustyll
        
      - name: Build
        run: rustyll build
        
      - name: Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4
        with:
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: _site
```

This workflow will build your site with Rustyll's superior performance and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

### Performance Comparison

| Action | Jekyll on GitHub | Rustyll Locally | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Full build | 30-60s | 1-3s | ~20x faster |
| Incremental build | 10-20s | 0.2-0.5s | ~40x faster |
| Site regeneration | Manual | Automatic | Immediate |

Your site is automatically generated by GitHub Pages when you push your source
files. Note that GitHub Pages works equally well for regular HTML content,
simply because Jekyll treats files without front matter as static assets.
So if you only need to push generated HTML, you're good to go without any
further setup.

The [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages)
is comprehensive and includes a [a guide to setting up a GitHub Pages site using
Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).
We recommend following this guide.

This page contains some additional information which may be useful when working
on GitHub Pages sites with Jekyll.

### Project Page URL Structure

Sometimes it's nice to preview your Jekyll site before you push your `gh-pages`
branch to GitHub. The subdirectory-like URL structure GitHub uses for
Project Pages complicates the proper resolution of URLs. In order to assure your
site builds properly, use the handy [URL filters]({{ '/docs/liquid/filters/' | relative_url }}):

{% raw %}
```liquid
<!-- For styles with static names... -->
<link href="{{ 'assets/css/style.css' | relative_url }}" rel="stylesheet">
<!-- For documents/pages whose URLs can change... -->
[{{ page.title }}]("{{ page.url | relative_url }}")
```
{% endraw %}

This way you can preview your site locally from the site root on localhost,
but when GitHub generates your pages from the `gh-pages` branch all the URLs
will resolve properly.

## Deploying Jekyll to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages work by looking at certain branches of repositories on GitHub.
There are two basic types available: [user/organization and project pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).
The way to deploy these two types of sites are nearly identical, except for a
few minor details.

### User and Organization Pages

User and organization pages live in a special GitHub repository dedicated to
only the GitHub Pages files. This repository must be named after the account
name. For example, [@mojombo's user page repository](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io) has the name
`mojombo.github.io`.

Content from the `master` branch of your repository will be used to build and
publish the GitHub Pages site, so make sure your Jekyll site is stored there.

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Custom domains do not affect repository names</h5>
  <p>
    GitHub Pages are initially configured to live under the
    <code>username.github.io</code> subdomain, which is why repositories must
    be named this way <strong>even if a custom domain is being used</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

### Project Pages

Unlike user and organization Pages, Project Pages are kept in the same
repository as the project they are for, except that the website content is
stored in a specially named `gh-pages` branch or in a `docs` folder on the
`master` branch. The content will be rendered using Jekyll, and the output
will become available under a subpath of your user pages subdomain, such as
`username.github.io/project` (unless a custom domain is specified).

The Jekyll project repository itself is a perfect example of this branch
structureâ€”the [master branch]({{ site.repository }}) contains the
actual software project for Jekyll, and the Jekyll website that you're
looking at right now is contained in the [docs
folder]({{ site.repository }}/tree/master/docs) of the same repository.

Please refer to GitHub official documentation on
[user, organization and project pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites)
to see more detailed examples.

<div class="note warning">
  <h5>Source files must be in the root directory</h5>
  <p>
    GitHub Pages <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/troubleshooting-jekyll-build-errors-for-github-pages-sites">overrides</a>
    the <a href="{{ '/docs/configuration/options/' | relative_url }}">"Site Source"</a>
    configuration value, so if you locate your files anywhere other than the
    root directory, your site may not build correctly.
  </p>
</div>

### Running and Testing Locally

Running Rustyll locally gives you significant speed advantages. Here's how to configure your environment:

```sh
# Install Rustyll
cargo install rustyll

# Run with the baseurl set to match GitHub Pages
rustyll serve --baseurl=""

# For even faster development with live reload
rustyll serve --baseurl="" --livereload --incremental
```

This will run the Rustyll server on your local machine at `http://localhost:4000`. Refer to [server options]({{ '/docs/usage/' | relative_url }}) for available options.

### Optimizing Build Speed with Rustyll

To get the most out of Rustyll when working with GitHub Pages:

1. Use Rustyll's parallel builds locally:
   ```bash
   rustyll build --threads auto
   ```

2. Enable incremental builds for faster feedback:
   ```bash
   rustyll serve --incremental
   ```

3. Create a local config override to keep GitHub Pages compatibility:
   ```yaml
   # _config_dev.yml
   baseurl: ""
   
   # Rustyll performance options (local only)
   threads: auto
   parallel: true
   cache:
     enabled: true
     strategy: aggressive
   ```

   Then run:
   ```bash
   rustyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml
   ```

4. For complex sites, consider setting up a continuous integration pipeline with GitHub Actions to deploy pre-built sites.
